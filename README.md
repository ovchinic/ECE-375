All Labs were completed using an AVR TekBots board provided by the university with an 8-bit Atmel Microcontroller (ATmega128). The accumulative objective of the labs was to design and implement code for the TekBot to work as an autonomous robot vacuum cleaner using various methods in assembly language.<br />
